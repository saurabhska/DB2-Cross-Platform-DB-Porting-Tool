DB2-Cross-Platform-DB-Porting-Tool
==================================
- IBM DB2 databases are OS specific. You can't simply take a backup of database from the AIX server and restore it on a Windows 
  server. 
- This tool, once configured, can be triggred manually or via CRON job to automatically port a DB2 database from the AIX to  
  Windows machine.
